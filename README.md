# AP Style Dates and Times

This plugin changes the format of the dates and times of your posts and comments to match Associated Press Style. This is perfect for news and magazine sites running WordPress and for those blog writers with a penchant for style consistency.

### Here's what it does:

- Adds periods to "am" and "pm" so they become "a.m." and "p.m."
- Removes extraneous zeros when the time is at the top of the hour. "1:00 p.m." becomes "1 p.m."
- Changes "12:00 a.m." to "midnight" and "12:00 p.m." to "noon."
- Correctly abbreviates months in the date to match AP Style rules. Those are: "Jan." "Feb." "March" "April" "May" "June" "July" "Aug." "Sept." "Oct." "Nov." "Dec."

### Optional features:

- If the post year is the same as the current year, you can set it to not print the year in the date output to adhere to AP Style rules.
- If the date of the post is the same as the current date, you can set it too print "today" instead of the date. Technically that's not an AP Style rule, but a common newspaper style nonetheless.
- You can have it capitalize the words "today," "noon" and "midnight."

Therefore, if your post was published at 1:13 in the afternoon on September 22, 2007, this plugin will make the time look like "1:13 p.m." and date look like "Sept. 22, 2007"
